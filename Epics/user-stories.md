## Designer / Design Team – User Stories

### Core Workflow Stories

#### Figma Upload & Code Export
As a UI designer, I want to upload my complete Figma file into the tool and export a ZIP containing structured, standards-compliant code, so that the development team can implement it with minimal translation errors.

#### Live Browser Preview
As a UI designer, I want to preview the generated code in a browser environment before exporting it, so that I can visually verify the design output before sharing it with the development team.

#### Design System Integration
As a UI designer, I want to provide and save my company’s design system specifications, so that each code generation automatically applies consistent tokens, styles, and branding.

#### Feedback and Correction Loop
As a UI designer, I want to give feedback or clarify context to the AI if code generation is inaccurate, so that I can resolve errors or ensure the output matches the design intent.

### Setup & Onboarding Stories

#### Guided Plugin Installation
As a UI designer, I want clear instructions on how to download and install the Figma plugin, so that I can begin using the tool without technical assistance.

#### Setup Confirmation Feedback
As a UI designer, I want confirmation that setup is complete and all systems are connected, so that I can confidently begin using the tool.

## Product Manager – User Stories

1. **Shareable Interactive Prototypes**  
   As a product manager, I want to upload a Figma design and turn it into a shareable, interactive website without leaving Figma, so that I can demo new features or flows to stakeholders in a realistic format.

2. **Control of Demo Specifications**  
   As a product manager, I want to upload product or feature specifications (e.g., user goals, constraints, copy), so that the demo reflects pre-approved messaging and strategic framing for stakeholder presentations.

3. **Traceability to Original Designs**  
   As a product manager, I want to include a link to the original Figma file with the live demo, so that stakeholders and collaborators can reference the design source if needed.

4. **Rapid Feature Validation**  
   As a product manager, I want to generate live previews of proposed features quickly, so that I can validate ideas with users or stakeholders before involving development resources.

5. **Automated Usability/Compliance Warnings**  
   As a product manager, I want the tool to flag accessibility or usability issues in the auto-generated demo, so that I can ensure stakeholder-facing prototypes meet company standards.

## Developer / Development Team – User Stories

1. **UI Code Delivery with Figma Reference**  
   As a front-end or full-stack developer, I want to receive auto-generated HTML, CSS, and component code from the designer’s Figma file—along with a link to the original design and all assets in a GitHub repository—so that I can focus on integrating business logic and backend functionality without rebuilding the UI from scratch.

2. **Auto-Generated Documentation**  
   As a developer, I want to receive a README file containing relevant design context and implementation notes, so that I can quickly understand the design intent and begin development without ambiguity.

3. **Code Validation and AI-Assisted Clarification**  
   As a developer, I want to validate my code updates against the original Figma design, internal design system rules, and usability standards, and be able to ask an AI agent for clarification, so that I can ensure my code is compliant, aligned with the design intent, and meets both internal and external expectations.

4. **Maintainable, Clean Code Output**  
   As a developer, I want the auto-generated code to follow clean, consistent, and documented patterns (e.g., semantic class naming, modular structure), so that I can edit, extend, or refactor it without having to rewrite large portions.

5. **Design Token Integration**  
   As a developer, I want the generated code to use reusable design tokens (for spacing, color, typography), so that it aligns with my team’s design system and can be integrated into existing UI libraries.

6. **Modular Component Output**  
   As a developer, I want the generated interface to be broken down into modular components (e.g., buttons, inputs, layouts), so that I can reuse and compose them in larger application contexts.
