# Personas and User Stories

## UI Designer  
*Uploading their design for a new application to give to the development team in a company*

- **As a UI designer**, I want to upload my new application design directly from Figma into the tool, so that the development team can receive structured, standards-compliant code and reduce translation errors in the form of a zip file.  
- **As a UI designer**, I want to be able to provide my company’s specifications to be saved so that each code generation factors in my company’s specifications.  
- **As a UI designer**, I want to be able to give feedback and talk to the LLM so that I am able to fix any errors or provide extra context for the code generation.  
- **As a UI designer**, I want to be able to view the generated code as it is being ran in a different browser, so that I can see what it looks like before giving it to the development team.

## Solo Developer or Student  
*Creating a personal project by uploading their UI design to speed up the process of design-to-code*

- **As a solo developer or student**, I want to upload my Figma design to generate a working frontend, so that I can quickly prototype and iterate on my personal project without hand-coding everything.  
- **As a solo developer or student**, I want the document to be easy to understand and follow standards across the internet, so that I don’t have to put much effort into checking and debugging things.

## Product Manager  
*Uploading a prototype to share a clickable demo for a meeting*

- **As a product manager**, I want to upload a Figma prototype and turn it into a shareable, interactive website, so that I can demo new features or flows to stakeholders in a realistic format.  
- **As a product manager**, I want to upload some specifications, so that I can demo new features or flows to stakeholders in a format that is already pre-established.  
- **As a product manager**, I want to have a link of the Figma design, so that everyone can have access to check out the original product themselves.

## Development Team  
*Receiving the auto-generated code from a designer and tweaking the code*

- **As a front end developer**, I want to receive auto-generated HTML, CSS, and component code from the designer’s Figma file as well as the link to the original Figma file itself, so that I can focus on integrating the logic and backend connections without rebuilding the UI from scratch.  
- **As a front end developer**, I want to be able to check my updates to the code as well as talk to an LLM about the original Figma file, so that I can ensure that the updated code meets company and basic standards as well as making sure I understand the full context of the original design.
