# Epic: Document-to-Code UI Generator via MCP Server

## Description
We are developing an MCP Server that allows users to upload documents that contain design guidelines for UI development and receive structured and functional front-end code in compliance with those guidelines.

By adding in a RAG and agentic AI systems, these tools will allow developers and designers to rapidly build prototype interfaces without having to manually modify the stylesheets of AI-generated code.

This tool will accept several types of files for input to be able to understand and process design guidelines from various formats (PDF, Figma export, Markdown, etc.) to ensure easy integration into any workflow, and to produce interfaces consistent with what the team or company wants.

To account for the diversity of software in the web development ecosystem, our server will also allow users to choose what framework they want their project built in (React/Angular/Vue/etc).

The system will:
- Accept documents
- Extract information from those documents using agents
- Use a RAG system to compare to and apply existing patterns and practices
- Output front-end code with the help of those agents

---

## Goals
- Users can upload design documents in a variety of formats (`.fig`, `.pdf`, `.png`, `.jpg`, `.docx`, `.md`, `.json`, `.html`, `.css`, `tailwind.config.js`) and receive working front-end code.
- Generated code complies with the userâ€™s customization specifications.
- All generated components look close to the initial product and provide basic functionality for any tests that may follow.

---

## Business Value
The product should speed up the process from initial design to code, eliminating the need to manually edit code to comply with design guidelines, and improve consistency between designs across teams.

It allows developers to create prototypes without having to manually tailor generated code to any design specifications, saving them hours of time by automating parts of the design process.

## Dependencies
- A working RAG component
- A working integration of the RAG
- A system of cooperating agents
- Document parsing software
- Front-end code engine

# User Stories

## User Story 1
**As a user**, I want to upload a document of my design  
**so that** the system can generate code.

---

## User Story 2
**As a user**, I want to specify styling and structural preferences  
**so that** future generated work matches my patterns and standards.

---

## User Story 3
**As a user**, I want to receive my code and be able to preview or run it  
**so that** I can see if it has matched my original design.

---

## User Story 4
**As a user**, I want to be able to give feedback on the code and design  
**so that** I can fix any issues or provide improvements.

---

## User Story 5
**As a developer**, I want to be able to extract the information from the image  
**so that** I can use it to generate code using agents.

---

## User Story 6
**As a system**, I want to use the agents and RAG to generate code from the parsed UI descriptions  
**so that** the code reflects both the design and user specifications.
