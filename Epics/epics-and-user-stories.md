# Epic: MCP Server for UI Code Generation from Design Documents

## Description
Developers and designers often waste hours modifying AI-generated code to meet internal design standards. To solve this, we are developing an **MCP Server** that allows users to upload documents containing design guidelines for UI development and receive structured, functional front-end code in compliance with those guidelines.

By integrating **RAG** and **agentic AI systems**, this tool enables rapid prototype interface generation without requiring manual modifications of AI-generated stylesheets. The server will support multiple input formats—including `.fig`, `.pdf`, `.png`, `.jpg`, `.docx`, `.md`, `.json`, `.html`, `.css`, and `tailwind.config.js`—to allow seamless integration into existing design workflows.

To accommodate the diverse frontend ecosystems in use, users can select the output framework (React, Angular, Vue, etc.). The server will:
- Accept documents,
- Use agents to extract UI information,
- Use a RAG system to align with prior user practices,
- Output front-end code with embedded custom specifications.

---

## Goals
- Allow users to upload design documents in a variety of formats and receive working front-end code.
- Ensure generated code matches user-defined customization and styling specifications.
- Provide generated components that closely resemble the original designs and offer baseline functionality for prototyping or testing.

---

## Business Value
This product will accelerate the transition from design to code, reducing the need for developers to manually conform generated code to internal style guides. It will promote **design consistency across teams**, and enable fast prototyping by automating major parts of the design-to-code workflow.

## Dependencies
- Working RAG component
- Integrated RAG with document workflows
- A system of cooperating agents
- Document parsing software
- Front-end code generation engine

## User Stories

### User Story 1
> As a user, I want to upload a document of my design so that the system can generate code.

### User Story 2
> As a user, I want to specify styling and structural preferences so that future generated work matches my patterns and standards.

### User Story 3
> As a user, I want to be able to receive my code and be able to preview or run it so I can see if it has matched my original design.

### User Story 4
> As a user, I want to be able to give feedback on the code and design to fix any issues or provide improvements.

### User Story 5
> As a user, I want to choose the frontend framework (React, Vue, Angular) so that the generated code fits into my existing tech stack.

### User Story 6
> As a user, I want to see what guidelines or components the system extracted from my document so I can verify or edit them before code generation.
