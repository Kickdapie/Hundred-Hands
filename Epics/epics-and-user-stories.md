# AI-Driven Figma-to-Code Converter for Seamless Web Publishing (Hundred Hands)

**Funnel Entry Date:** July 23, 2025  
**Epic Name:** AI-Driven Figma-to-Code Converter for Seamless Web Publishing (Hundred Hands)  
**Epic Owner:** Danny Nguyen, Kazuma, Rangarajan, and Sashank Bhagavatula

## 📘 Epic Description

Develop an AI-powered tool that converts complete Figma design files—including wireframes, interactive prototypes, component states, and design systems—into live, standards-compliant websites hosted via a Node.js local or remote server.

The goal is to eliminate the friction between design and engineering, enabling non-technical users to publish fully interactive websites and giving teams an automated bridge between Figma and working frontends. The tool will also:

- Check for compliance with design constraints like **WCAG**
- Adjust output accordingly
- Allow manual editing for technically proficient users

---

## 📈 Business Outcome Hypothesis

If designers and teams can convert their Figma files directly into accessible, live code via an AI agent, then we expect:

- ⏱ **Reduced time-to-launch** for new websites by over **70%**
- ⚡ **3× faster** design-to-development handoff cycles
- 🧑‍🎨 **Greater inclusion** of non-technical creatives in web publishing
- ✅ **Improved compliance** across web projects (Design System / Accessibility)

---

## 🔍 Leading Indicators

- ✅ AI successfully converts **>85%** of test Figma files into functioning websites without manual correction
- 🌟 Users rate conversion quality **>4.5/5** in early testing
- ♿ Over **60%** of prototypes pass **WCAG AA**-level accessibility audits post-translation
- 🔧 Reduced engineering support time during handoff by **50%**

---

## 🧩 Epic Type

- **Business Epic:** Enables value for non-technical users and design teams
- **Enabler Epic:** Builds foundational AI-to-code infrastructure and accessibility enforcement

---

## ⚙️ Nonfunctional Requirements

- WCAG 2.1 compliance for output HTML/CSS/JS
- Local Node.js runtime with hot-reload
- Plugin or API-level access to Figma’s full design + prototype structure
- Modular AI agent that can update based on new design system inputs
- Error logging and fallback rendering if code fails gracefully

---

## 🚧 Implementation Plan / Features

### ✅ Feature 1: Figma File Parser
- Import full file structure, including variants, components, and prototype paths

### ✅ Feature 2: AI Code Translator
- Interpret layout, logic, and style → output clean HTML/CSS/JS (React optional)

### ✅ Feature 3: Node.js Preview Environment
- Auto-generate a local runtime to preview and interact with the result

### ✅ Feature 4: Compliance Engine
- Analyze and modify output to meet design constraints (e.g., WCAG)

### ✅ Feature 5: Design System Alignment
- Let users upload or select a design system → AI adheres to its rules

### ✅ Feature 6: Error Reporting & Manual Overrides
- Optional layer for user correction if translation fails

### ✅ Feature 7: UX-friendly CLI / GUI
- Interface for non-dev users to launch and preview sites

---

## ✅ Acceptance Criteria

- Users can import a Figma file and view a working website **locally within 2 minutes**
- Converted output retains **>90%** design and interaction fidelity
- Output passes accessibility audits using tools like **Lighthouse** or **axe-core**
- System accepts uploaded design constraints and **applies them in code output**
- Tool works with at least **3 common design system types** (e.g., Material, Bootstrap, custom)
