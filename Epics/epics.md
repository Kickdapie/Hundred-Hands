# AI-Driven Figma-to-Code Converter for Seamless Web Publishing (Hundred Hands)

**Funnel Entry Date:** July 23, 2025  
**Epic Name:** AI-Driven Figma-to-Code Converter for Seamless Web Publishing (Hundred Hands)  
**Epic Owner:** Danny Nguyen, Kazuma, Rangarajan, and Sashank Bhagavatula

## Epic Description

We will develop an AI-powered tool that converts complete Figma design files (wireframes, interactive prototypes, component states, and design systems) into live, standards-compliant websites hosted via a Node.js local or remote server. The goal is to eliminate the friction between design and engineering, enabling non-technical users to publish fully interactive websites and giving teams an automated bridge between Figma and working frontends. Designers will be able to generate code directly within Figma and be able to download it as a .zip file, allowing them to run the code on a local or remote server and preview how their designs look on a working website. Once they approve, they can pass the code onto developers for further refinement, reducing the chance that developers will accidentally change the designers’ original designs. The tool will autonomously check for compliance with design constraints like WCAG and custom corporate guidelines (given by the user) and adjust output accordingly when generating code.

## Business Outcome Hypothesis

If designers and teams can convert their Figma files directly into accessible, live code via an AI agent, then we expect:

- **Reduced time-to-launch** for new websites by over **70%**
- **3× faster** design-to-development handoff cycles
- **Greater inclusion** of non-technical creatives in web publishing
- **Improved compliance** across web projects (Design System / Accessibility)

---

## Leading Indicators

- AI successfully converts **>85%** of test Figma files into functioning websites without manual correction
- Users rate conversion quality **>4.5/5** in early testing
- Over **60%** of prototypes pass **WCAG AA**-level accessibility audits post-translation
- Reduced engineering support time during handoff by **50%**

---

## Epic Type

- **Business Epic:** Enables value for non-technical users and design teams
- **Enabler Epic:** Builds foundational AI-to-code infrastructure and accessibility enforcement

---

## Nonfunctional Requirements

- WCAG 2.1 compliance for output HTML/CSS/JS
- Local Node.js runtime with hot-reload
- Plugin or API-level access to Figma’s full design + prototype structure
- Modular AI agent that can update based on new design system inputs
- Error logging and fallback rendering if code fails gracefully

---

## Implementation Plan / Features

### Feature 1: Figma File Parser
- Import full file structure, including variants, components, and prototype paths

### Feature 2: AI Code Translator
- Interpret layout, logic, and style → output clean HTML/CSS/JS (React optional)

### Feature 3: Node.js Preview Environment
- Auto-generate a local runtime to preview and interact with the result

### Feature 4: Compliance Engine
- Analyze and modify output to meet design constraints (e.g., WCAG)

### Feature 5: Design System Alignment
- Let users upload or select a design system → AI adheres to its rules

### Feature 6: Error Reporting & Manual Overrides
- Optional layer for user correction if translation fails

### Feature 7: UX-friendly CLI / GUI
- Interface for non-dev users to launch and preview sites

## Acceptance Criteria

- Users can import a Figma file and view a working website **locally within 2 minutes**
- Converted output retains **>90%** design and interaction fidelity
- Output passes accessibility audits using tools like **Lighthouse** or **axe-core**
- System accepts uploaded design constraints and **applies them in code output**
- Tool works with at least **3 common design system types** (e.g., Material, Bootstrap, custom)
