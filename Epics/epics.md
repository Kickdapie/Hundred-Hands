## Epic Description (Updated 7/29)

We will develop an AI-powered tool that converts complete Figma design files—including wireframes, interactive prototypes, component states, and design systems—into standards-compliant, production-ready web applications hosted on a local or remote Node.js server.

This tool will streamline the design-to-code handoff by allowing design teams to generate, preview, and export functional front-end code directly from Figma. Teams can download code as a `.zip`, run it locally or remotely, and optionally modify it in their preferred IDE. Once approved, the code can be handed off to development teams for further enhancement—preserving design intent and reducing misalignment.

The tool will also validate output against accessibility standards (e.g., WCAG) and custom organizational design constraints (Corporate Design Systems), autonomously adjusting code generation to ensure compliance.

## Business Outcome Hypothesis

If designers and cross-functional teams can convert their Figma files directly into accessible, production-ready code via an AI agent, we expect to achieve the following business outcomes:

### Accelerated Time-to-Launch
- Reduce average time-to-launch for new web applications by over 70%.
- Shorten design-to-development handoff cycles by 3×.

### Expanded Cross-Functional Contribution
- Increase participation from non-developer team members.
- Reduce engineering bottlenecks for frontend prototyping.

### Improved Standards and Compliance
- Improve adherence to WCAG 2.1 and internal design system guidelines.
- Lower UI/UX inconsistencies by preserving design intent.

## Outcome Categories and KPIs

| Outcome Category          | KPI                                                | Target                |
|---------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|------------------------|
| Time-to-Launch            | Average days from prototype to deployment           | Reduce by **70%**     |
| Developer Handoff         | Average developer onboarding time per feature       | Reduce by **3×**      |
| Non-developer Participation | % of contributors from design/product             | Increase by **50%**   |
| Compliance and Consistency | % of code passing WCAG + style checks before QA    | Increase to **95%**   |

## Nonfunctional Requirements

### Accessibility and Design System Compliance
- Output must conform to **WCAG 2.1 AA** and **corporate design system**.
- Validated through automated tools (e.g., Axe, Lighthouse) and manual review.
- Semantic HTML structure and ARIA roles required.

### Local Runtime Support
- Must support **local Node.js** development and preview.
- Target: **< 1.5GB RAM** usage at idle.

### Figma API Integration
- Must extract full design tree, tokens, and prototype flows via Plugin and REST API.

### Modular AI Agent Architecture
- Must support modular updates (e.g., for branding/design token changes).
- Support cloud-hosted **and** offline usage models.

### Graceful Degradation and Logging
- Must handle failures with fallback UI, logs, and preservation of original design state.

### Runtime Cost Awareness
- All cloud services must support:
  - Usage limits
  - Cost tracking
  - FinOps/reporting integration
